🚀 Business Landing Page Generator

A component-driven landing page system for building clean, professional business websites quickly — without rebuilding the same layouts over and over.

🧠 The Idea

Small businesses often need a simple, polished landing page — not a complex CMS or bloated website builder.

From a developer’s perspective, building these pages repeatedly leads to:

duplicated layouts

inconsistent UI decisions

hard-to-maintain codebases

This project explores a better approach: treat landing pages as reusable systems, not one-off designs.

🎯 What This Project Does

The Business Landing Page Generator is designed around modular, composable UI sections that can be assembled into complete landing pages.

The current implementation focuses on the frontend foundation:

structure

polish

responsiveness

interaction

The landing page included in this project represents what the generator can produce — a realistic, production-quality example rather than a static mockup.

✨ Highlights
🧩 Modular Sections

Hero, Features, Preview, CTA, etc.

Designed to be rearranged, reused, and extended

📱 Responsive by Default

Mobile-first layouts

Smooth scaling across screen sizes

🎥 Subtle Motion
