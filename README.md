# 🚀 siteGenie

**A component-driven system for building professional business landing pages — fast, clean, and maintainable.**

---

## 🧠 Why This Exists

Small businesses need polished landing pages, not bloated website builders.

Developers keep rebuilding the same layouts with:
- Duplicated code
- Inconsistent UI decisions  
- Hard-to-maintain structure

**siteGenie treats landing pages as reusable systems, not one-off designs.**

---

## ⚡ What It Does

Modular, composable UI sections that assemble into complete landing pages.

This repo contains the **frontend foundation** — structure, polish, responsiveness, and interaction. The landing page you see is what the generator produces: production-quality, not a mockup.

---

## ✨ Features

🧩 **Modular Sections** — Hero, Features, CTA. Rearrange, reuse, extend.  
📱 **Responsive by Default** — Mobile-first, scales smoothly.  
🎥 **Subtle Motion** — Lightweight animations that guide, not distract.  
🧱 **Scalable Architecture** — Clean components, easy to expand.

---

## 🛠 Built With

- **Next.js** — Framework
